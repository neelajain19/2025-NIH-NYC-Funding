			Ella Vardeman is frustrated.
		</p>

		<p>
			“It actually makes no sense to me,” the 28-year-old City University of New York doctoral student says. “What is the government’s end game here?” she wonders.
		</p>

		<p>
			Vardeman, who is studying how Haitian immigrants use plants to treat women’s health issues, is speaking about the Trump administration’s recent termination of hundreds of research grants supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The funding cuts follow January’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/" target="_blank">executive order</a> to terminate federally-funded initiatives supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion principles. 
		</p>

		<p>
			A current grantee of NIH’s F31 Predoctoral National Research Service Award, a prestigious fellowship program providing training and development opportunities to pre-doctoral scholars during their dissertation research, she is grateful for the award’s many benefits which have helped ease some of the burdens of graduate school, she says.
		</p>

		<p>
			“I’ve been able to get career opportunities like speaking at NIH seminars,” she says. “That’s on top of having my salary paid for, so I didn’t have to teach as much and could really focus on my research.”  
		</p>

		<p>
			Vardeman, who will see her three-year fellowship come to an end this spring when she graduates with a PhD in plant sciences, knows that, as a young researcher, NIH awards like hers are critical to students’ future success as research scientists. That makes her all the more upset by the federal funding cuts. To date, over 600 NIH-supported grants have been cancelled under the order equalling, according to estimates, nearly <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833880" target="_blank">1.8 billion dollars</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			“It’s so important for people to get this type of research training in school,” she says. “If you cut off opportunities for that we’re not going to have scientists anymore.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Vardeman’s concerns are not without cause.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Trump administration’s termination of NIH funding has disproportionately impacted grants supporting the training and development of science doctoral candidates and early career researchers, data shows.
		</p>

		<p>
			Analysis of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Tracking Accountability grants <a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf" target="_blank">database</a> found that F series grants have the highest rate of termination among the most commonly awarded NIH grants. The grants, which provide research experience through individual fellowships covering tuition and fees, lab supplies, and travel expenses for students and scientists at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels, saw a termination rate of 2% based on volume of F series’ active awards. Active F awards prior to termination totalled 3,605 based on data from <a href="https://report.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NIH Report</a>, a federal database of NIH-funded research projects. Of those, 72 awards were cancelled.
		</p>

		<p>
			In comparison, R series grants, which are designed to support research projects for individuals at varying stages of their career, from early-career to senior research scientists, were found to have the second lowest termination rate among the most commonly awarded series of grants. This was despite R grants having the highest number of active awards prior to termination with data showing only 389 awards out of a total of 51,458 active awards cancelled, resulting in a termination rate of 0.76%.
		</p>

		<p>
			The analysis, which is based on federal data between February 28th and April 8th, is subject to updates as the administration continues to terminate grants, or even in some cases, reinstate grants as was the case last month for a seven-year, $38 million <a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2025/03/utah-clinical-and-translational-science-institute-federal-funding-restored#:~:text=On%20March%2029%2C%202025%2C%20the,Translational%20Science%20Institute%20(CTSI)." target="_blank">grant</a> awarded to the University of Utah.

			Regardless of future actions by the administration, the analysis reflects a troubling trend for aspiring researchers and early-career scientists, says Claire Pomeroy, M.D., president and chief  executive officer of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, a medical research advocacy organization.
		</p>

		<p>
			“Where the timing of a disruption in one’s funding happens matters on one’s career trajectory,” she says. “So these young people are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in support.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Referencing F grant programs that specifically seek to provide funding to racial groups traditionally underrepresented in the biomedical field, Dr. Pomeroy worries about how the grant terminations will impact the diversity of the scientific pipeline. Blacks and Hispanics represented only 15% of the 7,004 doctoral recipients in the biomedical sciences in 2023 according to <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/earned-doctorates/2023#data" target="_blank">data</a> from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.   
		</p>

		<p>
			“It’s important to remember the impact of a lack of resources to bridge one’s self through these moments of disruption in education and training,” she says. “That risks disproportionately hitting those who have been historically excluded in the field.”
		</p>

		<p>
			She also notes how the challenging state of federal science funding could result in multiple forms of ‘brain drain’ for the country, undercutting its global leadership in scientific innovation. Hesitation among international students to pursue doctoral programs in the sciences at US universities is likely, she says. The data analysis found that Institutional Training Grants, also known as T series grants, which award funding to institutions to support the establishment of research training programs for doctoral and post-doctoral researchers, have the third highest rate of termination at 1.60%. 
		</p>

		<p>
			An exodus among students and early career researchers to universities abroad offering a robust stream of science training and development opportunities would compound the problem. In March, the University of Aix-Marseille in France announced the development of <a href="https://www.univ-amu.fr/en/system/files?file=2025-03/Safe%20Place%20for%20Science%20call%20for%20applications%2019032025.pdf" target="_blank">Safe Place for Science</a>, a program offering 16 million dollars over a three-year period to a contingent of US researchers.
		</p>

		<p>
			Elena Fuentes-Afflick, M.D., chief scientific officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, believes young researchers’ increasing frustration with the current funding shortfall could lead them to leave the field of science entirely.
		</p>

		<p>
			“The path to becoming a biomedical researcher takes a long time, so people invest years of their life to pursue this,” she says.  “But with fewer opportunities, people could change their mind and pivot into some other career.”
		</p>

		<p>
			She also notes that organizations like hers have been working since the grant terminations were first announced to identify ways to sustain the funding pathway for careers in science. She cast doubt that philanthropy, an often mentioned source of revenue to lessen the impact of the cuts, could replace NIH funding. Aside from whether philanthropy even has the financial capacity to make up for the funding gap, the question of where philanthropic organizations’ choose to prioritize their funding in this time of limited resources also persists, she said, citing competing federal funding shortfalls in education and the arts. 
		</p>

		<p>
			NIH could not be reached for comment on this story.
		</p>

		<p>
			Dr. Fuentes-Afflick says these increasing unknowns make it all the more important for the public to advocate for the future of science. 
		</p>

		<p>
			“Funding for research impacts virtually every American,” she says. “By raising our voices and talking about the importance of research and sharing our opinions with our elected officials, we can all support the research enterprise.”
